3ds rom builder for testing romhacks.

* Command line usage
* Allows you to have a clean romfs folder and a patch romfs folder, no need to merge them beforehand.
* Build romfs in ram to save time & disc usage. Only works on mono because of MemoryStream limitations. Append "--lowram" to the end of your command to disable if using on Windows.
* No encryption, speeds up build times. Patch from https://github.com/exelix11/3DS-Builder-citra/commit/586bb4edd3efc934dd9267a8ad9c8238ee75591a

Usage:
Just run it without arguments to see.
